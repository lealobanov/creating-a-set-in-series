Here you execute a transaction to create a new set. First you borrow a reference to the admin resource from the AuthAccount and afterwards you use the admin account to access the borrowSeries function.

Once that happens you are able to get access to the series you input in the parameters if it exists. After that you have access the addNftSet function to add as many sets as you would like.
